description: Validate plan-code consistency, architecture compliance, and code quality before developer artifacts are written. Use as the developer-layer quality gate.

# Skill: validate-dev-consistency

**File:** `skills/validate-dev-consistency/SKILL.md`
**Version:** 0.2.0
**Used by:** Developer

---

## Purpose

Validate consistency between Implementation Plan, generated code, Story ACs, architecture constraints, and code quality standards (SOLID, Clean Code, style) before any artifact is written to disk. Mandatory gate — no artifact is written if any blocking check fails.

## Interface

| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistent formatting**       | Code must follow consistent indentation, line length, and bracket style throughout the module       | `"<file>" has inconsistent formatting at line <n>`       |
| **Idiomatic error handling**    | Error handling must follow the idiomatic pattern for the target language, applied consistently      | `"<file>" uses non-idiomatic error handling at line <n>` |
| **No unnecessary abstractions** | No interfaces, base classes, or wrappers introduced without a concrete reason traceable to the Plan | `"<file>" introduces unnecessary abstraction "<name>"`   |

### Group 7 — Chesterton Check (Blocking)

| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Missing procedure reference**     | A Plan implements a pattern with no corresponding procedure                           | `⚠️ PLAN-<id> implements pattern "<name>" with no procedure coverage — consider emitting CR to Process layer` |
| **Single test case per AC**         | An AC has only one unit test case                                                     | `⚠️ PLAN-<id> AC-<n> has only one test case — verify edge cases are covered`                                  |

| **Long function**                   | A function exceeds 30 lines — may indicate a Single Responsibility violation          | `⚠️ "<file>" function "<name>" is <n> lines — consider splitting`                                             |
| **Deep nesting**                    | A function contains more than 3 levels of nesting — may indicate complex control flow | `⚠️ "<file>" function "<name>" has <n> nesting levels — consider extracting`                                  |

## Behavior

1. Run all blocking checks first. Collect all failures before returning.
2. Run all warning checks.
3. Return output object.
4. If `status: fail`:
   - Agent must not write any artifact.
   - Agent presents all `blocking_failures` to user with plain-language explanations.
   - Agent asks how to resolve before retrying.
5. If `status: pass` with warnings:
   - Agent may write artifacts.
   - Agent presents warnings to user after writing.
